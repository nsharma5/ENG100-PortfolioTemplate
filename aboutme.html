	<p>Hi my name is Neha Sharma and I am currently a Computer Science major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and originally from India.
	I finished my high school career in a small island country called Mauritius. In high school, I took part in debating, public speaking and I was also the lead in my school's production of "King Lear".
	My hobbies include dancing and reading novels. Fun fact: I have already lived in 3 different countries and USA would be my fourth country to live in.</p>
	
	<p>While at UIUC, I am interested in joining ACM SigPony (an ACM special interest group for cybersecurity), WCS (Women in Computer Science), and going on a Chicago trip with the people from LLC (Global Crossroads). I look forward to making new friends from all over the world! </p>
	
	<p>	Take a second to look at my <a href="assets/Resume-FirstnameLastname.pdf">r�sum�</a>!</p>
