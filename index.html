            	<table><tr><td>Hi! My name is Neha Sharma and I am currently a Computer Science major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and originally from India.</td></tr>
                <tr><td table border="10" background-color:#27FF0B><a href="projects.html">Projects</a></td>
                <td float="center"><img src="NehaSharma.jpg" alt="In Mauritius"></td></tr>
                <tr cellpadding="10" cellspacing="20"><td>I finished my high school career in a small island country called Mauritius. In high school, I took part in debating, public speaking and I was also the lead in my school's production of "King Lear".</td>

                <td cellpadding="20" cellspacing="20">My hobbies include dancing and reading novels. Fun fact: I have already lived in 3 different countries and USA would be my fourth country to live in.</td></tr>

		        <p>While at UIUC, I am interested in joining ACM SigPony (an ACM special interest group for cybersecurity), WCS (Women in Computer Science), and going on a Chicago trip with the people from LLC (Global Crossroads). I look forward to making new friends from all over the world!</p>
